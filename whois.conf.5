.TH "WHOIS.CONF" "5" "9 April 2013" "Petr Písař" "Debian GNU/Linux"

.SH "NAME"
whois.conf \- alternative WHOIS servers list for whois client

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B /etc/whois.conf

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This file contains a list of WHOIS servers which can augment or override
the built-in list of the client.

It's a plain text file in ASCII encoding. Each line consists of two fields:
a pattern to match WHOIS object identifier and a corresponding WHOIS server
domain name.

Fields are separated by non-empty sequence of space or a tabular characters.
A line starting with a hash character is a free comment and it's not
considered.

The pattern is case-insensitive extended regular expression if whois client
has been compiled with POSIX regular expressions support. Otherwise, simple
case-insensitive suffix comparison against WHOIS object identifier is used.

Internationalized domain names (IDN) must be specified in ascii-compatible
encoding (ACE) format.
