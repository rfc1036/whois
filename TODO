Still to sort:
*NETBLK-RIPE* *NET-RIPE* *APNIC* *AUNIC-AU*

Is MNT-* a standard of some registry?

What about rwhois?

Should support the refer attribute of RIPE-189 objects.

I need a procedure for searching an IPv6 address in a list.
Will anybody contribute it?

Can ARIN netblock names have a dash?

Should "=" be prepended by default when an NSI-style NIC handle is detected?

Add Exodus rwhois server (e.g. 216.35.0.0/16).
