Native Win32 porting with MinGW is currently incomplete 
(localization and manpage are missing and there are
 some problems with text encoding).

The "whois.exe" executable runs on Windows XP, Vista, Seven, Eight and it does 
not require a specific runtime.


BUILD REQUIREMENTS
* Windows XP, Vista, Seven, Eight
* MinGW gcc-core, mingw-runtime, mingw32-make are required to build.
* The commands "cc" and "mingw32-make" must be in the PATH.
* You need Perl. The command "perl.exe" must be in the PATH.
* To build: cd to the source directory and issue "mingw32-make".


I18N SUPPORT (INTERNATIONALIZED DOMAIN NAMES AND NON-ASCII SERVER SUPPORT)
To support i18n you need:
* libiconv (which is included in standard MinGW installation)
* libidn (precompiled binaries are available at ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libidn/)
* To build: cd to the source directory and issue:
  mingw32-make HAVE_LIBIDN=1 HAVE_ICONV=1

In order to obtain a standalone executable, libiconv and libidn 
are statically linked. To change this, modify the relevant section in the Makefile.
