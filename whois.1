.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwhois\fP searches for an object in a \fIRFC-812\fP database.

This version of the whois client tries to guess the right server to
ask for the specified object. If no guess can be made it will connect
to whois.internic.net for domains,
.\" whois.networksolutions.com for nic handles,
whois.arin.net for IPv4 addresses and whois.6bone.net for
IPv6 addresses.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-h HOST
Connect to HOST.
.TP 8
.B \-H
Do not display the legal disclaimers some registries like to show you.
.TP 8
.B \-p PORT
Connect to PORT.
.\" .TP 8
.\" .B \-C
.\" First query \fIwhois.internic.net\fP to find the registrar for a GTLD subdomain.
.\" This option overrides \fB-h\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-V
Be verbose.
.TP 8
Other options are flags understood by RIPE-like servers.
.SH NOTES
.\" The default server for gTLDs is \fIwhois.networksolutions.com\fP.
.\" Unless the \fB-C\fP option is used the CRSNIC shared whois server is
.\" \fBnot\fP queried and domains registered by other registrars will be
.\" reported as unknown.
.\" .P
Please remember that \fIwhois.networksolutions.com\fP by default will
only search in the domains database. If you want to search for hostnames,
NIC handles or people names you have to prepend the appropriate keyword
(\fIHO\fPst, \fIHA\fPndle or \fINA\fPme).
.P
When querying \fIwhois.arin.net\fP for AS numbers, the program will
automatically convert the request in the appropriate format, inserting
a space after the string "AS".
.P
When querying \fIwhois.ncst.ernet.in\fP for a string without spaces, the
\fIdomain\fP keyword is prepended.
.P
When querying \fIwhois.corenic.net\fP, machine readable output is requested.
.P
RIPE-specific options are ignored when querying non-RIPE servers.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP LANG
When querying \fIwhois.nic.ad.jp\fP english text is requested unless the
\fILANG\fP environment variable specifies a Japanese locale.
.IP "WHOIS_SERVER"
This server will be queried if the program cannot guess where the object
is located. If the variable does not exist then
\fIwhois.internic.net\fP will be queried.

.SH HISTORY
This program closely tracks the user interface of the whois client
developed at RIPE by Ambrose Magee and others on the base of the
original BSD client.
I also added support for the protocol extensions developed by David
Kessens of QWest for the 6bone server.
